An example drawing/aimbot hook for UE4 on Unreal Tournament 4

1) You must dump and fix up the SDK yourself if this current one stops working.
Included .zip (SDK.zip) with the SDK files.

2) Rotator aimbot works, but is linear with no velocity check.

3) No teamcheck, it's custom or undefined in this game.
